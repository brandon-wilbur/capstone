# Deliverable:

Much like last semester, Brandon and Ryan will be completing sprints, as of now, at a 3 week basis, with the opportunity to go to 2 week sprints as an option. The process will be much like last semester as well. Both of us will create Virtual Lab environments in both Linux and Windows, while also making Lab Guides for the students to follow in order to try to complete the tasks within the lab. These ideas are largely come up with by us, with some assistance coming from Duane as well. At the end of our sprints, we will meet up with Duane to see what he thinks of our product so far, any changes he would want us to make or additions to complete. This sprint went more like our previous attempts, a return to normalcy if you would will. Brandon will continue to head the Windows side of development for this sprint, working on System Hardening this time around. Ryan will go back to his normal Linux work, this time covering multiple subjects that all are concerned about monitoring your system. That is cron, processes, services and checking your mounted devices. This will be heavily information based, like the Packet Tracer lab, but they will have a VM they can mess around with this time around. I believe all of this information, while not related at first, is very helpful for a student to learn about. All can be used to monitor your system one way or another, which is very crucial for the real world and for CyberPatriot competitions.
Objectives:

Our objectives here are not much different from other objectives in our previous sprints. Since each sprint is focusing on a specific task needed for CyberPatriot, this sprint will be focused on researching the information we need in order to complete our Labs on time. For Brandon, that would be looking up the necessary information in order to enumerate and hide ports and services on a Windows Machine. Ryan will be focused also on research for the most part, and finding out ways to demonstrate all of these different commands and how to use them properly. Once that is complete, it is as simple as just getting into the workflow of our assignment. If anything a bulleted list will look something like this:

* Research Topic (Hardening/Cron and More)
* Begin to work on lab once well versed enough within the topic
* While working on the lab, make sure to write the documentation at the same time to put freshly completed concepts and ideas down onto paper.
* Continue this process until we view it as complete enough
* Meet up with each other to see what we have completed thus far, usually a week prior to meeting with Duane
* Complete any small fixes with the Lab or the Lab Guide before meeting with Duane
* Meet with Duane to go over the lab and lab guide, take his comments to make any fixes that he sees before handing it into our Google Drive

# Discrete Tasks:

Unlike other teams, Brandon and Ryan do not necessarily have tasks that they need to split up for both of them to complete a sprint in a normal sense. Rather, this Capstone overall is designed to have the work split up evenly between the both of us between usually two different Operating Systems or tools. Not only that, but the discrete tasks that both of us would need to complete end up being pretty similar at a quick glance. In essence it boils down to a lot of research, implementation, documentation and then presenting. Besides a discrete due date of March 15th 2021 to be the day we present our work to Duane, we pretty much work at our own pace due to our vastly different schedules. However, we have agreed to some dates ahead of time such as these. Once again these are very loose and can be completed or started whenever, but these our rough guidelines for tasks for this sprint:

* 2/19/21: Choose a topic to focus on for current Sprint
* 2/19/21: Begin research on topic for current Sprint
* 2/26/21: Begin work on current Sprint (Can be started whenever ready, start today by the latest)
* 3/5/21: Progress check, meet up with each other to see what we have completed thus far
* 3/12/21: Last meeting before presenting to Duane, have we completed everything that we needed to? Any last minute fixes?
* 3/15/21: Present Sprint to Duane, fix any issues he sees, choose the next Sprint topic possibly as well here
