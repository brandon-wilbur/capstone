# Project Objectives

This capstone project will be organized into two-week sprint cycles that will include deliverables at the end of each sprint. To organize this, Ryan and I setup a Trello Team where we will be organizing our research and tasks to best fit into these sprints.

## Research Dashboard

We will be going to the Research Dashboard for high-level overviews of the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that we'd like to cover. This can be populated by ourselves or based on suggestions and recommendations from others.

## Sprint Dashboard

This will be the location where we will be organizing our two-week sprint cycles. We will break down tasks that we need to do for each cycle into workable items. As tasks are completed, they will be moved from the sprint backlog to the completed state for review at the end of each cycle. Meetings will likely occur once a sprint cycle to discuss results and improvement for the next cycle.

## Deliverables

Each sprint cycle will require two lab guides and two vulnerable environments: one each for Windows and Linux. With Linux, vulnerable environments can be distributed directly via exported virtual machines. Due to licensing, Windows environments will likely take the form of PowerShell scripts or compiled PowerShell scripts that the student can run to configure a preexisting virtual machine. All tasks per each sprint cycle should focus on producing these deliverables.
