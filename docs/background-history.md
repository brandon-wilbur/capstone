# Project Background and History

## History

The CyberPatriot Program was founded in 2001 where vulnerabilities were investigated on a Windows system with just a small number of teams. After this successful trial run and positive responses from participants and mentors, the program continued and expanded. This program is now focused on high school students where competitions are held annually. Students have the ability to compete up to the national level upon moving forward multiple rounds.

The training resources that are being developed are Windows and Linux virtual machines that are intentionally vulnerable. A similar project that already exists and focuses on web application security is Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA), an intentionally vulnerable web server. While this draws a parallel to the project that we are developing, there isn't a widely available set of virtual machines focusing on vulnerabilities within Windows and Linux. 

## Background

Students in the CyberPatriot program receive training in teams that are registered in the competition. Training that students receive is usually dependent upon the adult supervisors of their individual team. Though there are some basic resources distributed by the parent organization, students are missing formal lab guides that help simulate what they may see in the competition. Distributing formal lab guides through the parent organization will give all students more equitable training regardless of the technical expertise of their mentors.

While it is possible that local teams have created training resources for self-use, CyberPatriot does not publish lab environments for training on their public site. Duane Dunston has previously had students assist with basic vulnerability scripts that deal with what we have begun to create on a smaller scale. It is possible that we are one of the first groups looking to produce labs for the organization to redistribute at scale.
