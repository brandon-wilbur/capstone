# Ethical Concerns and Implications

This project can have ethical concerns that arise from the possible weaponization of the resources that I am providing. The scenarios that I am creating where machines are intentionally vulnerable require me to automate attack scenarios within PowerShell. If this source code is obtained, this can allow someone with malicious intent to automate an attack against a Windows machine.

## Mitigation

This concern could be mitigated by controlling access to the source code and obfuscating the resources that are distributed to teams. My scripts could be intentionally obfuscated via the Invoke-Obfuscation utility or with other resources to attempt to mitigate the chance that an individual will see the commands that are being run to leave a machine vulnerable. Access control to my resources will mostly be out of my control, however, as they will be distributed to various Cyberpatriots entities that will administer the resources to teams.
