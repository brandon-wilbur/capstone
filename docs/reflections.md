# Week 2 Reflection

During this period, we communicated with Duane and Devin and ironed out our reporting schedule for the semester for the stages of our project. We're going to continue our previous model but start with one deliverable every three weeks, ending with a meeting with Duane and Devin to discuss our progress. At this time, I am going to continue working on Windows labs and Ryan is going to work on Linux. We came up with a list of possible lab ideas that weren't yet touched upon from last semester:

* password hardening
* Apache vulnerabilities
* phpMyAdmin vulnerabilities
* SSH key permission misconfiguration
* Cisco Packet Tracer
* Nirsoft CurrPorts network / process enumeration
* Scheduled tasks and services
* Cronjobs
* Mounted media

At this point, I have started to work on a lab using Nirsoft CurrPorts to identify a vulnerable Windows Virtual Machine, and Ryan is focusing on Cisco Packet Tracer labs. These two were identified by Duane as priority items that teams would like to work with. We also discussed the possibility of working with teams directly and presenting content to interested students. Work on the project so far has continued as usual and feels on par with last semester's tempo.
