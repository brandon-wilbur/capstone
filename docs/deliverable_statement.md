# Deliverable Statement: 
Much like last semester, Brandon and Ryan will be completing sprints, as of now, at a 3 week basis, with the opportunity to go to 2 week sprints as an option. The process will be much like last semester as well. Both of us will create Virtual Lab environments in both Linux and Windows, while also making Lab Guides for the students to follow in order to try to complete the tasks within the lab. These ideas are largely come up with by us, with some assistance coming from Duane as well. At the end of our sprints, we will meet up with Duane to see what he thinks of our product so far, any changes he would want us to make or additions to complete. However, for this sprint, something is going to be a little bit different. Brandon will continue to head the Windows side of development for this sprint, working on Port and Service Enumeration. However, Ryan will be working on an aspect that has previously not been covered in our previous sprints. After our in class presentation, and meeting with Duane, the need for Packet Tracer tutorials are something this much needed for the students of CyberPatriot. Covering topics such as setting up two computers to communicate with each other with static IP addresses, to setting up ARP for communication within a small network, these students need this information. For this reason, Ryan will begin to create Packet Tracer tutorials, this time with the usage of recorded videos for the students to use alongside a written up lab guide.

# Objectives:
Our objectives here are not much different from other objectives in our previous sprints. Since each sprint is focusing on a specific task needed for CyberPatriot, this sprint will be focused on researching the information we need in order to complete our Labs on time. For Brandon, that would be looking up the necessary information in order to enumerate and hide ports and services on a Windows Machine. Ryan will be focusing on refreshing skills within Packet Tracer and make sure to complete the needed information that Duane said the students would need to know for packet tracer. Once that is complete, it is as simple as just getting into the workflow of our assignment. If anything a bulleted list will look something like this:


# Research Topic (Port Enumeration/Packet Tracer Networking)
Begin to work on lab once well versed enough within the topic
While working on the lab, make sure to write the documentation at the same time to put freshly completed concepts and ideas down onto paper. For Ryanâ€™s case recording videos would need to be completed as well.
Continue this process until we view it as complete enough
Meet up with each other to see what we have completed thus far, usually a week prior to meeting with Duane
Complete any small fixes with the Lab or the Lab Guide before meeting with Duane
Meet with Duane to go over the lab and lab guide, take his comments fo make any fixes that he sees before handing it into our Google Drive

# Discrete Tasks:
Unlike other teams, Brandon and Ryan do not necessarily have tasks that they need to split up for both of them to complete a sprint in a normal sense. Rather, this Capstone overall is designed to have the work split up evenly between the both of us between usually two different Operating Systems or tools. Not only that, but the discrete tasks that both of us would need to complete end up being pretty similar at a quick glance. In essence it boils down to a lot of research, implementation, documentation and then presenting. Besides a discrete due date of February 19th 2021 to be the day we present our work to Duane, we pretty much work at our own pace due to our vastly different schedules. However, we have agreed to some dates ahead of time such as these. Once again these are very loose and can be completed or started whenever, but these are our rough guidelines for tasks for this sprint:

* 1/29/21: Choose a topic to focus on for current Sprint
* 1/29/21: Begin research on topic for current Sprint
* 2/5/21: Begin work on current Sprint (Can be started whenever ready, start today by the latest)
* 2/12/21: Progress check, meet up with each other to see what we have completed thus far
* 2/18/21: Last meeting before presenting to Duane, have we completed everything that we needed to? Any last minute fixes?
* 2/19/21: Present Sprint to Duane, fix any issues he sees, choose the next Sprint topic possibly as well here
